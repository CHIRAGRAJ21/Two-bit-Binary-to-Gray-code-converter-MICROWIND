Gray Code system is a binary number system in which every successive pair of numbers differs in only one bit. It is used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers generated by the hardware may produce an error or ambiguity during the transition from one number to the next bit and from here, the significance of a Binary to Gray code converter could be derived.
