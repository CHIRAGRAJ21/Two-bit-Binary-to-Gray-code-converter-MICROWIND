Using the MICROWIND and DSCH software, a CMOS combination was assembled to form an XOR gate, which in turn by combination with two inverters formed a triumphant working model of a 2 bit Binary to Gray code converter through successful utilization of its’ truth table, gate level and transistor level schematic diagram and a stick diagram for an efficient CMOS implementation which would provide an unordered series of Gray encoded bits in result as a output of four possible combination of binary bits. through efficient and optimal realization of its dimensions, rise time, fall time and propagation delays.
